								<h2>2008-2009: Lonely Road</h2>
								<p align="justify">In June 2007, according to Billboard.com, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus began to work on their second album, Lonely Road, that had "a tentative release date being summer 2008." The band was then pulled out of their confirmed appearances at the Australian Soundwave festival tour 2008, after their label president promised to pay money that was owed and have the band in the studio, but instead didn't pull through.[citation needed]In April 2008, the band began an acoustic tour on the east coast in various locations with the group Amaru, who is from the same home town. Ronnie said that the tour felt like they were "Getting back where we all started. "After pulling out of the 2008 Soundwave festival, the band took part in the line-up for 2009.On September 30, 2008, the band announced in a Myspace blog that on October 3, they would be premiering a demo version of a song from the upcoming album. The song was available a day earlier for members of The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus "Alliance" fan group. However, the studio of the song "Pen and Paper" was released to members of the "Alliance" fan group on October 9, and was released on the band's Myspace the following day. Another song, "You Better Pray", the first single from "Lonely Road", was premiered worldwide on PlanetRadio1073.com for free listening beginning on October 21 and began streaming the next day on the band's Myspace page.Their second studio album, titled Lonely Road, was released on February 3, debuting in the fourteenth spot in The Billboard 200, and was produced by Howard Benson (My Chemical Romance, Daughtry, Less Than Jake, Hoobastank, P.O.D., The All-American Rejects, Seether, Cold).Beginning in October 2008, Matt Carter had replaced former guitar player Elias Reidy. Carter was seen working as a tech for the band in the winter and spring of 2008. He had previously jammed with the band before, but decided to pursue something else. Matt was asked to take his spot and has agreed to play with The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. In an interview with a Jacksonville newspaper, Ronnie was asked whether or not Matt was officially in the band, to which he responded, "I don't know. I guess he's in the band. We're taking it slow." Matt has been playing with red jumpsuit ever since.In support of this album the band has done many tours in the Winter of 08/09 and the Spring of 2009 with bands such as Shinedown, Framing Hanley, Tickle Me Pink, and more.On March 20, 2009, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus released an EP titled Shock Session, featuring acoustic versions of "Pen & Paper", "You Better Pray", and "Face Down".At the end of May 2009, they announced along with Hollywood Undead, Mest, and The Sleeping that they would be doing a summer tour for the months of June and July, playing mostly club and small venue shows. They will be rejoining Monty Are I for an August 2009 tour throughout Canada and California.</p>
								
								<h2>2010-2012: The Hell or High Water EP and Am I the Enemy</h2>
								<p align="justify">On January 29, 2010, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus announced via their Twitter page that they would have a new EP out in late July/August.In February 2010, the band parted ways with their label Virgin Records, citing the poor promotion of Lonely Road. They decided to release music independently. According to lead singer Ronnie Winter, "At this point we want to stay completely 100% independent for as long as possible." The first such song was "Valentine," which was released for free on Valentine's Day, February 14, 2010.On June 22, 2010, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus announced via Myspace blog that their upcoming EP release would be titled The Hell or High Water EP, and that the first song from it, "Choke", would be released on June 28, 2010 as a free download. The EP was recorded in the band's studio in Middleburg, Florida, and was mixed and mastered by Paul Lapinski. This was their first release following their departure from Virgin Records and it was released on August 24, 2010. The full-length album following the EP will be out in early 2011. The music video for the first single from the EP, "Choke", premiered at purevolume.com on August 25, 2010 in support of the EP's release. It was part one of a three-part series, followed by "Don't Hate" and "Hell or High Water". It shows characters killing record executive-type personnel, running from the police, and then dying in the final video. The moral was violence never solves anything.In November 2010, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus entered the studio to record their third full-length album, Am I the Enemy, finishing in December 2010 with producer John Feldmann. The album's first single, "Reap", was released via YouTube on March 24, although the song itself was not released to iTunes until April 26. The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus later released two other songs from their new album on their YouTube channel, "Salvation" and "Fall from Grace". A June 7 announcement on the band's Facebook page said the new album Am I the Enemy will be released on August 30, 2011. It will contain twelve songs. On July 11, 2011, lead singer Ronnie Winter announced that guitarists Duke Kitchens and Matt Carter had left the band "to focus on their personal lives", with longtime Red Jumpsuit Apparatus fan Josh Burke joined as lead guitarist. This was followed by a YouTube video on July 17 welcoming Josh Burke as the official lead guitarist of the band replacing Matt Carter. Ronnie's brother, Randy Winter, was later added as the second guitarist filling-in for Duke Kitchens.In mid-October, drummer Jon Wilkes decided to depart from the band in order to "...pursue new things and make a living" as a producer. According to Wilkes, he left the band on good terms and wished them the best in their future endeavors. He was temporarily replaced by Kristopher Comeaux while the band was touring, but Comeaux departed shortly after.</p>

									<h3>About Us</h3>
									<p>The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is an American rock band that was formed in Middleburg, Florida, in 2003.Originating in Florida, childhood friends Ronnie Winter and Duke Kitchens started the band while attending an AP music theory class, in 2001. The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus was officially formed in 2003 after the addition of other members that were currently in other bands. The band name, 'Red Jumpsuit Apparatus', was chosen by the band voting for random words they threw on a wall.</p>
									<p>The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus worked with Vision Sound studios in Orange Park, Florida, which released a "6 song EP CD that was spread throughout different countries to promote the band in 2005". The band also began to become more popular as they used certain social media (Myspace) to advertise their music. While popular in their local scene, the band found it difficult to secure label support. This is why the band had taken time to write songs for a "period of 18 months before they went into the live scene." As they continued to increase live shows and performances, Red Jumpsuits' fan base continued to build to an almost unheard-of level for a local band. This escalating fan base attracted Jason Flom of Virgin Records in 2005 where they then started to work on their first album.</p>
